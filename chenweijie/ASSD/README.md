# ASSD -  Android-Specific Smell Detection

ASSD is a Java-based open-source tool for detecting Android Anti-Patterns (code smells);
simply install JDK 1.8 and set up Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA, 
clone or download the repository and open it in the IDE, then run ASD.
java—the main GUI entry—browse to any Android project to start parsing, tick the desired code smells,
click “Start Parsing” followed by “Detect Selected Code Smell,” 
and the detected issues together with their class names and full paths will appear in the customised console at the bottom,
ending with a total count; press Reset whenever you want to switch to another project.

The following screenshot of the ASSD GUI shows the tool browsing, selecting an arbitrary Android project, and ticking smells for detection.
